============

Partial reimplementation of FMOD with OpenAL.

Once a great stronghold, now much of it stands in ruins.

Similar project: https://github.com/moon-chilled/openfmod

What You Need
-------------

* [fsb-extract-dumb](https://github.com/moon-chilled/fsb-extract-dumb)
* [python-fsb5](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5) with extract.py (fsb5-extract module on OpenBSD)
* [manifest files](https://files.catbox.moe/yej6xx.tgz)
* json-c
* openal
* vorbisfile
* alut (freealut)

How To Use
----------

Same preparation as with [openfmod](https://github.com/moon-chilled/openfmod):

- Grab fsb-extract-dumb (https://github.com/moon-chilled/fsb-extract-dumb)
- run fsb-extract-dumb file.bank
  generates a file like file.fsb
- Grab python-fsb5 (https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5)
  python3 extract.py file.fsb -o file.banko
  * (Don't use pypy, it's slower.)
- so:
  for i in *.bank; do fsb-extract-dumb "$i"; fsb5-extract "${i/bank/fsb}" -o "${i}o"; done

- You also need manifest files for all the bank files.
- For celeste, use (https://files.catbox.moe/y1p0gd.tgz)
  - (Actually, use https://files.catbox.moe/yej6xx.tgz)
  - Extract, and move all json files into the same directory as the .bank files.

How to Build
------------

```
$ make
```

And Then?
---------

Drop file `libfmodstudio.so` in the game's directory. Make sure the dllmap file(s) for the game point for all {,lib}fmod{,studio} to this file.

What Works
----------

* Celeste (partially; being tested at the moment)

Other games remain to be seen...
